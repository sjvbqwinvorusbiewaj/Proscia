    <h1>Lanthanum (La)</h1>
       <dl>
        <dt>Element Name:</dt>
        <dd>Lanthanum (La) is a chemical element belonging to the lanthanide series, a group of rare earth metals. Although the term "rare earth" might suggest scarcity, lanthanum is relatively abundant in the Earth's crust.</dd>

        <dt>Atomic Mass:</dt>
        <dd>138.9055 u<br>Atomic mass represents the average weight of all isotopes of an element, taking into account their natural abundance. The value of 138.9055 u indicates that lanthanum is one of the heavier elements among the rare earths.</dd>

        <dt>Atomic Number:</dt>
        <dd>57<br>The atomic number indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of a lanthanum atom. This positions lanthanum in the f-block of the periodic table, among the metals of the lanthanide series.</dd>

        <dt>Number of Isotopes:</dt>
        <dd>Lanthanum has several isotopes, but the most stable is La-139. An isotope is a variant of an element that possesses the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Lanthanum isotopes are used in nuclear and scientific applications.</dd>

        <dt>Mass Number (Isotopes):</dt>
        <dd>137, 138, 139<br>These values represent the total number of protons and neutrons in the isotopes of lanthanum. The most abundant isotope is La-139, which is stable and non-radioactive.</dd>

        <dt>Melting Point:</dt>
        <dd>920 °C (1688 °F)<br>This temperature indicates the point at which lanthanum transitions from a solid to a liquid state. The relatively low value compared to other metals makes it malleable and easily workable.</dd>

        <dt>Boiling Point:</dt>
        <dd>3460 °C (6260 °F)<br>The boiling point represents the temperature at which lanthanum transitions from a liquid to a gaseous state. This value indicates that lanthanum is resistant to extreme temperature conditions, making it useful in industrial applications.</dd>

        <dt>Density:</dt>
        <dd>6.15 g/cm³<br>The density of lanthanum is relatively low compared to heavier metals like tungsten or gold. This makes it useful in metal alloys, adding lightness to materials without compromising strength.</dd>

        <dt>Electronegativity:</dt>
        <dd>1.1 (Pauling scale)<br>Electronegativity measures the ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond. The value of 1.1 indicates that lanthanum is not very electronegative and tends to lose electrons, readily forming ionic bonds.</dd>

        <dt>Year of Discovery:</dt>
        <dd>1839, Carl Gustaf Mosander<br>Lanthanum was discovered by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander while studying a mineral containing cerium. His discovery marked an important step in the study of rare earths.</dd>

        <dt>Abundance:</dt>
        <dd>Lanthanum is present in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite. Although not rare, its extraction requires advanced techniques to separate it from other rare earth elements.</dd>

        <dt>Characteristics:</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Silvery-white metal, soft and malleable.</li>
                <li>It oxidizes easily upon contact with air and water, forming compounds such as lanthanum oxide (La₂O₃).</li>
                <li>It possesses paramagnetic properties, meaning it can be influenced by magnetic fields but does not retain permanent magnetism.</li>
            </ul>
